      <description>Have you ever wondered which reddit community is the most postive and which the most negative? Well, the figure below shows the average of comment sentiment score by subreddit. Given r/PublicFreakout’s dedictiation to “people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public” it’s no wonder its average comment sentiment is the lowest of the top 100 subreddits. We can also see that commentors on subreddits such as r/mildlyinfuriating, r/news and r/politics tend to leave relatively negative comments.</description>

(Note: if you are viewing this in mobile, the frame below is probably wider than the text in the rest of this post. This is my first post and I’m a newbie at HTML. If anyone knows how to make an iframe look good on both mobile and desktop simultenously, I’d love to learn from you!</description>
