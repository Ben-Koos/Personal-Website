      <description>Given that I’m stuck inside becasue of COVID-19, I figured it would be a great time to start the website I had alwasy been thinking about starting. And what better post to start off with then about COVID-19.

As someone who works in economic consulting, it’s interesting to me to think that even decades from now, economists will need to control for the effects of coronoavirus in their models.</description>
